Major depressive disorder accelerates DNA methylation age, a biological aging marker. Subclinical depressive symptoms are common, but their link to DNA
methylation aging in older adults remains unexplored. This study analyzed the crosssectional
relationship between depressive symptoms and accelerated DNA methylation
aging, considering gender and race/ethnicity in U.S. adults aged over 50. We used
data from 3,882 diverse participants in the 2016 Health and Retirement Study wave,
measuring blood DNA methylation age against chronologic age for acceleration.
Depressive symptoms were assessed using the CES-D scale. Multiple linear
regression evaluated the association between depressive symptoms and DNA
methylation age acceleration, adjusting for sociodemographic factors, blood cell
proportions, and health behaviors (physical activity, alcohol use, smoking, and chronic
conditions). Gender and race/ethnicity modifications were also tested. Depressive
symptoms, measured by continuous CES-D score, high depressive symptoms (CES-D
≥4), or any symptoms (CES-D ≥1), significantly correlated with increased GrimAge
DNA methylation age acceleration (all p≤0.001) in unadjusted and sociodemographicadjusted
models but were nonsignificant in fully adjusted models. No significant gender
or race/ethnicity effect modifications were found in fully adjusted models. Nonetheless,
a marginal interaction existed between any depressive symptoms and non-Hispanic
Black or other race/ethnicity (B=0.57, SE=0.30, p=0.06) on GrimAge age acceleration
in fully adjusted models, and a significant interaction between high depressive
symptoms and female gender (B=-0.83, SE=0.41, p=0.04) in minimally adjusted
models. Health behaviors significantly influence DNA methylation age acceleration and
depressive phenotypes, underscoring the need to understand their roles in assessing
psychological factors related to DNA methylation age acceleration.
